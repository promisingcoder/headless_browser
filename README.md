# LinkedIn Profile Extractor

## Overview

**LinkedIn Profile Extractor** is a Python-based tool designed to automate the process of scraping LinkedIn profiles using a headless browser. The extractor gathers essential information from LinkedIn profiles, including the user's name, headline, current company, location, LinkedIn URL, and any associated websites. The data is then stored in a CSV file for further use or analysis.

The project leverages `undetected-chromedriver` to bypass LinkedIn's bot detection mechanisms and uses `selenium` to control browser actions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/promisingcoder/linkedin-profile-extractor.git
   cd linkedin-profile-extractor
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
   - Ensure that you have Chrome installed on your system.
   - The script uses undetected-chromedriver to automatically install the appropriate ChromeDriver version.

4. **Prepare the links.txt or links2.txt file:**
   - Generate LinkedIn profile URLs using `return_profile_links.py` by executing:
     ```bash
     python return_profile_links.py
     ```
     This script searches for relevant LinkedIn profiles based on a predefined query and saves the profile URLs to `links2.txt`.
   - Alternatively, you can manually add LinkedIn profile URLs (one per line) to `links.txt`.

5. **Cookies:**
   - Before scraping, save your session cookies using `save_cookies.py`.
   - After logging into LinkedIn, run the script and press Enter when prompted. The cookies will be saved to `linkedin_cookies.txt`.
     ```bash
     python save_cookies.py
     ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Scraper:**
   ```bash
   python browser.py
   ```
   - The script will read the LinkedIn URLs from `links.txt` or `links2.txt`, navigate to each profile, and scrape the necessary information.
   - The data will be saved to `profiles.csv`.

2. **Customize Scraping Logic:**
   - You can modify the scraping logic in the `scrape_profile` and `scrape_contact_info` functions within `browser.py` to capture additional data points or handle different LinkedIn profile layouts.

3. **Viewing Output:**
   - The scraped data will be stored in `profiles.csv`. Open this file with a spreadsheet application like Excel or any CSV viewer to analyze the collected data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Headless Mode:**
  - By default, the extractor runs with a visible browser window for easier debugging. Uncomment `options.add_argument('--headless')` in `HeadlessBrowser.get_options()` to run it in headless mode.

- **Captcha Issues:**
  - The extractor uses undetected-chromedriver to avoid LinkedIn's detection, but if you encounter CAPTCHA challenges frequently, consider adding delays (sleep) between actions or rotating your IP address.
